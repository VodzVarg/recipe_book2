## Available Scripts

Before proceeding, ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To get started, make sure you have React-scripts installed:

### `npm install react-scripts --save`

### Building Web Assets:

To build your web assets, run:

### `npm run build`

### Sync to Android Project:

To sync the updated web assets to your Android project, use the Capacitor CLI:

### `npx cap sync android`

### Building in Android Studio:

Once the web assets are updated and synced, you can rebuild your Android project. You can do this in Android Studio:

1. Click the "Run" button.
2. Alternatively, use the build commands within Android Studio.

If you prefer the command line, you can open your Android project directly from the terminal:

### `npx cap open android`
